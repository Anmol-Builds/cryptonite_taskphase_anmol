#Module 1: Hello Hackers 
the module 1 'hello hackers' was a pretty basic module that consisted of two questions introduction to commands and arguments


Intro to commands 
Here we had invoke a message in the terminal and using the echo function where in I had to type echo hi to get back a "hello" from the terminal.I solved this easily as I did clearly what was instructed.

Intro to arguments
This is very similar to the previous task but here we had to get a message "Hello Hackers!" without using the echo function. This was easy to do and I got it in my first try as it was explained clearly.
